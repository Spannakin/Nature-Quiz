### Design Choices
* Overview

   I wanted to keep the design clean and simple for the user to focus on the game.

* Fonts

   I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to select the fonts used on the site.
   The fonts I chose were 
   
* Icons

   I used icons from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") 
   
* Colours
   I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to find the color palette for the site, I decided to go for a range of blues and greys as this is a
   subtle theme and will not be distracting to the user as they take the quiz.
